# CONTINUE POMODORO LOCK SESSION

## Context
- You were debugging and refining the Pomodoro Lock app, focusing on system tray icon issues, .deb install, and service/UI logic.
- The last issue: The correct tray icon appears, but it shows up twice when the UI is launched.
- You have made sure only one instance of the UI should run (single-instance lock), and the code only creates one SystemTrayIcon per process.

## What to do next
1. **Check for multiple running UI processes:**
   - Run: `ps aux | grep pomodoro-ui.py`
   - Kill any extras: `kill <PID>`
2. **Restart the XFCE panel to clear orphaned icons:**
   - Run: `xfce4-panel -r`
3. **If the issue persists, review the code for any accidental double instantiation of PomodoroUI or SystemTrayIcon.**
4. **Test launching the UI from the app menu and from the terminal to see if both create icons.**
5. **Continue debugging or ask the AI assistant for further help.**

## How to resume this session
- Reopen your terminal and navigate to your project:
  `cd ~/Code/pomodoro-lock`
- Reopen this CONTINUE_PROMPT.txt for context.
- If using the AI assistant, upload or paste this file and say: "Continue from this point."
