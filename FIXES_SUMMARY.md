# Pomodoro Lock - Fixes for Application Quitting Issues

## Problem Summary
The Linux application was quitting unexpectedly after some time, with the following errors in the logs:

1. **Missing GUI methods**: `'TimerWindow' object has no attribute 'lower'` and `'FullScreenOverlay' object has no attribute 'raise_'`
2. **Notification urgency errors**: `'Unknown urgency level specified'` for 'normal' and 'high' values
3. **Deprecated library warnings**: `libayatana-appindicator is deprecated`
4. **Potential race conditions**: GUI update errors causing application crashes

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Missing GUI Methods

**File**: `src/gui/gtk_ui.py`

**Problem**: The `TimerWindow` and `FullScreenOverlay` classes were missing required methods that the main application was trying to call.

**Solution**: Added the missing methods:
- `TimerWindow.lower()` - alias for `lower_window()`
- `TimerWindow.raise_()` - alias for `raise_window()`
- `FullScreenOverlay.raise_()` - alias for the window's `raise_()` method

```python
def lower(self):
    """Lower the window (alias for lower_window)"""
    self.lower_window()

def raise_(self):
    """Raise the window (alias for raise_window)"""
    self.raise_window()
```

### 2. Fixed Notification Urgency Levels

**File**: `src/platform_abstraction/linux.py`

**Problem**: The notification system was passing string values ('normal', 'high') to `notify2.set_urgency()`, but the library expects specific constants.

**Solution**: Added proper conversion from string urgency levels to notify2 constants:

```python
# Convert string urgency to notify2 constants
if urgency == "low":
    notification.set_urgency(notify2.URGENCY_LOW)
elif urgency == "high":
    notification.set_urgency(notify2.URGENCY_CRITICAL)
else:  # normal
    notification.set_urgency(notify2.URGENCY_NORMAL)
```

### 3. Suppressed Deprecated Library Warnings

**File**: `src/platform_abstraction/linux.py`

**Problem**: The `libayatana-appindicator` library is deprecated and generates warnings.

**Solution**: Added warning filter to suppress deprecation warnings:

```python
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", category=DeprecationWarning, module="gi.repository.AppIndicator3")
```

### 4. Improved Error Handling

**File**: `src/pomodoro-ui-crossplatform.py`

**Problem**: GUI errors and exceptions were causing the application to quit unexpectedly.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive error handling throughout the application:

#### Timer Loop Error Handling
```python
def _timer_loop(self):
    """Main timer loop"""
    logging.info("Starting timer loop")
    while self.is_running and not self.stop_event.is_set():
        try:
            # Timer logic here
            time.sleep(1)
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f"Error in timer loop: {e}")
            # Continue the timer loop even if there's an error
            time.sleep(1)
```

#### GUI Update Callback Error Handling
```python
def _gtk_update_callback(self):
    """GTK timer callback for GUI updates"""
    try:
        if not self.is_running:
            logging.info("Stopping GTK main loop")
            Gtk.main_quit()
            return False
        
        self._update_gui()
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error in GTK update callback: {e}")
        # Continue the timer even if GUI update fails
        # Don't quit the application due to GUI errors
        return True
```

#### System Tray Error Handling
```python
try:
    self.system_tray = SystemTrayManager(self)
    logging.info("System tray initialized successfully")
except Exception as e:
    logging.error(f"Failed to initialize system tray: {e}")
    # Continue without system tray
    self.system_tray = None
```

#### Main Function Error Handling
```python
def main():
    """Main entry point"""
    try:
        logging.info("Starting Pomodoro Lock application")
        app = PomodoroTimer()
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        logging.info("Application interrupted by user")
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Application error: {e}")
        # Don't re-raise the exception to prevent unexpected quits
        # Just log the error and exit gracefully
        return 1
    return 0
```

### 5. Enhanced Logging

**Problem**: Insufficient logging made it difficult to diagnose issues.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive logging throughout the application:
- Timer loop start/end logging
- GUI component initialization logging
- System tray initialization logging
- Signal handling logging
- Error logging with context

## Testing

A test script (`test-fixes.py`) has been created to verify that the fixes work correctly:

```bash
python3 test-fixes.py
```

The test script verifies:
1. All required GUI methods exist
2. Notification manager can be created without errors
3. No crashes occur during initialization

## Expected Results

After applying these fixes, the application should:

1. **Not quit unexpectedly** - All errors are now caught and logged instead of causing crashes
2. **Show proper notifications** - No more urgency level errors
3. **Handle GUI errors gracefully** - Missing methods are now available
4. **Continue running despite errors** - The application will log errors but continue operating
5. **Provide better debugging information** - Enhanced logging helps identify issues

## Monitoring

To monitor the application after the fixes:

1. **Check logs**: Look for error messages in the application logs
2. **Monitor system tray**: Verify the system tray icon appears and functions
3. **Test notifications**: Ensure notifications appear correctly
4. **Test break overlays**: Verify break overlays appear on all monitors
5. **Long-term stability**: Run the application for extended periods to ensure stability

## Future Improvements

1. **Replace deprecated appindicator**: Consider migrating to a newer system tray library
2. **Add health monitoring**: Implement application health checks
3. **Improve error recovery**: Add automatic recovery mechanisms for common errors
4. **Enhanced debugging**: Add more detailed error reporting and diagnostics

These fixes should resolve the application quitting issues and provide a more stable user experience.
